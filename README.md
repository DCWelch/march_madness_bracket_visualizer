# March Madness Bracket Visualizer

A tool to create visualizations of the NCAA Division I men's and women's basketball tournament brackets using only HTML, CSS, and JS.

Along with this tool is a simple dataset containing the team name, seed, and score for each team in each game of each tournament from 1939 to 2024 for the men's tournament, and 1982 to 2024 for the women's tournament, sourced from [NCAA.com](https://www.ncaa.com/).
